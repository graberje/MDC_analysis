# MDC_analysis

## Data requirements
This analysis relies on from the NIH Toolbox study. Please request access to this data before attempting to run the R code. The required files are named "MotorItems.tab", "MotorScores.tab", and "HeightWeight.tab". Once you've requested access and downloaded these files, place them inside a new folder named "data" inside the repository.

## Reproducibility
We used the renv package for reproducibility. To use the renv package, open the R project file and call the function renv::restore() to install the package versions from CRAN used in the original analysis.

## Run the analysis
We have provided both .R and .RMD files that can be used to run the analyses. Once you've downloaded the repository and completed the steps above, you should be able to recreate our analyses, figures, and tables with these files.
